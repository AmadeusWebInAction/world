[Movements was foreseen](https://imran.yieldmore.org/dear-brother/) by @@Imran@@ in 2013 as a number that spontaneously springs up to illumine a new age of peace and love. It's conclusion is quoted below.

> A hundred different movements began that systemmatically and lovingly changed the status quo. The animal instincts were humanized and the human instincts were hallowed and heightened.<br /><br />
> Some here were given an instinct they trusted and maybe some inkling of the days to come, but only as in a dream, a promise of tomorrow, but one that had to be built.<br /><br />
> Rejoice they did in their work, those reunited brothers and sisters. For they trusted in the sense of vision of things to come, and fretted not at the travails ahead for they knew the strength of their numbers, the numbers of their Bright Ones, and the effulgence of their Mother.
