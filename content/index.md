AmadeusWeb.world is integrating elements of

* community (rivalling social media)
* value of content (rivalling blockchain and crypto)
* fresh transparent AI training from a whitelist of websites (from a movement such as the Aurobindonian one)

And is set to power large numbers of websites and organizations - all with the shared objective of using love as a driving force to uplift the human condition.

Our "Growth Model" is now in version 4 and is in the works. It will be mandatory to adopt to use our technology and teams.
