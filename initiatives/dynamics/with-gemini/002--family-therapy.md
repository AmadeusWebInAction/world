## Initial Sessions (Months 1-3):

* **Assessment and Goal Setting:** The therapist will work with the family to understand the nature of the conflict, the history of the relationship, and the goals for therapy.
* **Building Trust:** The therapist will create a safe and supportive environment where family members can express themselves honestly.
* **Identifying Communication Patterns:** The therapist will help the family identify harmful communication patterns and develop healthier ways of interacting.

## Middle Phase (Months 4-6):

* **Addressing Underlying Issues:** The therapist will help the family address the root causes of the conflict, such as unresolved anger, resentment, or past traumas.
* **Conflict Resolution Skills:** The therapist will teach the family effective conflict resolution strategies, such as active listening, empathy, and compromise.
* **Boundary Setting:** The therapist will help the family establish healthy boundaries to protect their emotional and physical well-being.

## Later Phase (Months 7-9):

* **Strengthening Family Bonds:** The therapist will help the family develop stronger emotional connections and create positive shared experiences.
* **Practice and Reinforcement:** The therapist will provide opportunities for the family to practice new communication and problem-solving skills in a safe and supportive environment.

## Termination Phase (Months 10-12):

* **Reviewing Progress:** The therapist will review the family's progress and celebrate their achievements.
* **Developing a Maintenance Plan:** The therapist will help the family develop a plan for maintaining healthy relationships and resolving future conflicts.

* **Trust in the Process:** Trust in the therapist's guidance and the therapeutic process.
